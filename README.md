- **npm** (comes with Node.js) or **yarn**
- **Git** - [Download here](https://git-scm.com/)
- **MongoDB** (local installation) or **MongoDB Atlas** account

### Project Structure

```
odoo-Hackathon/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ client/          # Frontend (React + TypeScript + Vite)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ server/          # Backend (Node.js + Express)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
```

### Setup Instructions

#### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kotak-Prerit/odoo.round1.git
cd odoo-Hackathon
```

#### 2. Backend Setup

Navigate to the server directory and install dependencies:

```bash
cd server
npm install
```

#### 3. Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the `server/database/` directory with the following variables:

```env
# Database Configuration
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://your-username:your-password@your-cluster.mongodb.net/rewear

# JWT Secret (generate a secure random string)
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secure-jwt-secret-key

# Google OAuth Configuration (optional)
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id
GOOGLE_SECRET_ID=your-google-client-secret

# Email Configuration (for notifications)
EMAIL_USER=your-gmail@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-gmail-app-password
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:5173
```

#### 4. Frontend Setup

Navigate to the client directory and install dependencies:

```bash
cd ../client
npm install
```

#### 5. Cloudinary Setup (Image Upload)

Create a `.env` file in the `client/` directory:

```env
VITE_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your-cloudinary-cloud-name
VITE_CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET=your-upload-preset
```

To set up Cloudinary:

1. Create a free account at [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/)
2. Get your Cloud Name from the dashboard
3. Create an upload preset in Settings ‚Üí Upload ‚Üí Upload presets

### Running the Project

#### Option 1: Run Both Servers Simultaneously

1. **Start the Backend Server**:

   ```bash
   cd server
   npm start
   ```

   The backend will run on `http://localhost:5000`

2. **Start the Frontend Server** (in a new terminal):
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm run dev
   ```
   The frontend will run on `http://localhost:5173`

#### Option 2: Using Package Scripts

If you have a root `package.json` with scripts (optional):

```bash
# From the root directory
npm run dev        # Start both frontend and backend
npm run server     # Start only backend
npm run client     # Start only frontend
```

### Accessing the Application

1. **Frontend**: Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`
2. **Backend API**: Available at `http://localhost:5000/api`

### Key Features to Test

1. **User Registration/Login**: Create a new account or log in
2. **Browse Items**: Visit `/browse` to see all available items
3. **List an Item**: Add new items with images via Cloudinary
4. **Swap System**: Create swap requests between users
5. **Dashboard**: View your listings, purchases, and swap requests
6. **Product Details**: Click on any item to see detailed information

### API Endpoints

The backend provides the following main endpoints:

- `POST /api/users/register` - User registration
- `POST /api/users/login` - User login
- `GET /api/items` - Get all items (with pagination)
- `POST /api/items` - Create new item
- `GET /api/items/:id` - Get specific item

### Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues:

1. **MongoDB Connection Error**:

   - Verify your MongoDB URI in the `.env` file
   - Ensure MongoDB Atlas allows connections from your IP
   - Check if MongoDB service is running (for local installations)

2. **Cloudinary Upload Issues**:

   - Verify your Cloud Name and Upload Preset
   - Ensure upload preset is set to "unsigned" mode

3. **Email Notifications Not Working**:

   - Use Gmail App Password instead of regular password
   - Enable 2-Factor Authentication on your Google account first

4. **Port Already in Use**:
   - Backend: Change port in `server/app.js`
   - Frontend: Vite will automatically suggest an alternative port

#### Development Commands:

```bash
# Backend
cd server
npm run dev          # Run with nodemon (auto-restart)

# Frontend
cd client
npm run dev         # Development server with hot reload
npm run build       # Build for production
npm run preview     # Preview production build
```
